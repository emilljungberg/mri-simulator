The balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) sequence is comprised of RF pulses with alternating positive and negative flip angles. 
It is a very efficient sequence, however, it is sensitive to off-resonance effects which is illustrated in the figure below. The different magnetization 
vectors have different resonance frequences and at a certain frequency the steady state condition yields a zero signal. This gives rise to 
so-called "banding artefacts".
